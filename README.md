# An Adaptive Memory Multi-Batch L-BFGS in PyTorch
The repository contains the source code of the paper "An adaptive memory multi-batch L-BFGS algorithm for neural network training" by Federico Zocco and Se√°n McLoone. The paper has been accepted at the 21st IFAC World Congress, which is going to be held in Berlin in July 12-17, 2020. 

I am going to upload the code as soon as the paper is published (roughly August/September 2020).

Link to the paper: 

Note that the "ETCH" case study, i.e. Experiment 2 of the paper, is not included in this repository because the "ETCH" dataset is not publishable.
